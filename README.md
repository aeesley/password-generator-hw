# password-generator-hw

INTRODUCTION

This is a student project from Northwestern University's Fall 2020 Full Time Coding Bootcamp Program.

The project was to make a random password generator using Javascript.

The project features an html page, a style sheet, and a javascript file. Only the javascript file was edited per project instructions.

This project is not currently functioning. While working through the project over several days a lot of code was written and attempted, but nothing was executed to a fully functioning project. 

Pseudo code is included in commented text at the top of the page, and each piece of code has a comment which explains the strategy and purpose behind the coding attempt.

There are several password generator examples that could have been copied online, but instead I felt it would be more fruitful for my learning to only work from class activities and my tutor session and submit the non functioning code for feedback. I'm hoping with feedback I could continue too work on this and resubmit when it's functioning.

DOCUMENTATION

HTML, style, and a small portion of the JS code were provided by the course. The rest of the code was added by the project creator, Alex Eesley. As stated above, this code is not functioning at the moment.
